# Scrabble

A multiplayer scrabble program designed using the object-oriented programming model. The game begins with the program reading tiles (letters and their points) from a text file which are then randomly distributed to the players. Each player on their turn places tiles on board to form a word. The program checks the validity of the word and increments the playerâ€™s score accordingly. At the end of the game, the player with the highest score is declared as the winner.
